# deep-learning-challenge

The purpose of this analysis was to create a tool that can help a nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks and the features in the provided dataset I created a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
